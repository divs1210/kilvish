Me:
-> start working on physics (start with collisions) >collisions done!
-> see if I need to implement an ad-hoc version of box2d. Would be interesting.
-> JLayeredPane can work out of the box if add(comp, Integer) is used.
-> IMPORTANT: show splashscreen when constructor is called. remove when play() is called.
